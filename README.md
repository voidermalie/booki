# Hello ðŸŒ»
[This](https://voidermalie.github.io/booki) is a static site, my very first project during my web developer course at OpenClassrooms.

I remember discovering the power of flexbox and CSS ðŸŒ¼ and the concepts of Material Design through this project while integrating the site from a mockup.

## ðŸ’§Technologies Used
    HTML5
    CSS3
